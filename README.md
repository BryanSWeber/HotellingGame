# HotellingGame

This code executes a simple Hotelling game for two players. 
It allows both players to make a move, and then calculates the payoff for both participants.
It also displays visual content for players so they can see their positions on a graph.
This should help them more easily conceptualize the game.

This activity should be executed in a classroom setting and accompanied with an explanation of the rules of the game.
